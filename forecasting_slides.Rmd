## Forecasting


Time series:

  * Statistical analysis of past historical data 

  * Assumes causal relationships are stable (e.g. effect of a promotion, seasonal etc.)

  * Good for short or medium term planning (e.g. yearly budget of an existing product range, electricity demand)

  * Include moving average and weighted moving average for a larger data set (number of occurrences)
  
  
## Examples of Time Series Data

Examples of time series data include:

  * Quarterly sales results for Amazon

  * Weekly retail sales

  * Daily IBM stock prices

  * Hourly electricity demand

  * Time-stamped stock transaction data

Anything that is observed sequentially over time is a time series
  
## Forecasting

For accurate and reliable predictions, specific conditions must be met when forecasting:

  * how well we understand the factors that contribute to it;
  
  * how much data is available;

  * how similar the future is to the past;
  
  * whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast.

## Example: Electrcity Demand

Temperatures significantly affect electricity demand, while other factors, such as holidays and economic conditions, have a minor effect.

Several years of historical data

Short-Term Forecasting: Usually safe to assume demand will be similar to historical (weeks)

As a Residential User, usually the price of electricity is not dependent on the demand. This means that demand forecasts have little to no effect on consumer behavior. 


## Decomposition

We want to look at the components of the series. This helps us dive into the series for analysis. The following components consist of the series:

  * Trend
  
  * Seasonal Component
  
  * Remainder
